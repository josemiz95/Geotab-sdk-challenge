# Geotab SDK Challenge
Create a backup application to progressively download vehicle data. You must use the Geotab SDK to get the required data and store it in a file locally. Requirements:
- Download all available vehicles locally in a CSV file (one file per vehicle).
- Each vehicle file should include at least: ID, timestamp, VIN, Coordinates, and Odometer.
- Incrementally download new data and append it to the end of the same file (ex. every minute).
- Use any language, but make it clear and easy to execute on any computer (ex. Shell scripts, python, node, Java, .net console app, etc. are considered “easy to execute”).
- The data downloaded must match what you can see about the vehicles (assets) on the myGeotab web application
Demo database and credentials: Sent by email, and it’ll be active for a few weeks.
Evaluation criteria: follow the requirements, simplicity & clarity, easy to execute. The combination of these criteria will imply “easy to maintain”.
